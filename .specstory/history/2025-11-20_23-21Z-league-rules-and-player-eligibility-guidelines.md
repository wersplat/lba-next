# League rules and player eligibility guidelines (2025-11-20 23:21Z)

_**User (2025-11-20 23:14Z)**_

Rules page with multiple tabs:

Player Eligibility:

In order to obtain draft eligibility, a player must complete one of the following;

1. 5 combine games submitted

2. 3 HOF ARENA LEAGUE screenshots (completed during the combine period) 

3. 1 Win in either HOF ARENA/HOF MIDDAY/ HOF OVN with all active members from this league (subject to commissioner interpretation and must be within the combine period)

4. have a subscription with UPA and be a UPA Member at the start of the season to skip the entire combine process. (Please keep in mind this doesn’t guarantee you will be drafted)

The Commishioner has the right to remove anyone from the draft board at any point. A full refund of a paid tag will be provided if you have not broken any rules. 

During the regular season, in order to be eligible to play and be a Free Agent you must have been on the Draft Board prior to the season’s first pick.



General Team Rules:

EACH TEAM WILL HAVE THE FOLLOWING ROSTER 



1 GM

minimum of 6 rostered players 

Maximum of 7 rostered players

At no point prior to first game should any roster be below 7 including the GM

————————————————————

As a player you must load up for any team that drafts you. 

You CANNOT: 

1. Publicly demand a trade 

2. Refuse to load because of a losing record

3. Consistently choose other 2K obligations over LBA League Games

You CAN:

1. play wherever you like, just finish your season here

2. Privately ask for a trade 

3. Deny being a Keeper after 3 seasons

————————————————————

Player KEEPER RULES 

You can keep any player drafted in any of the 5 rounds of the LBA draft. 

You may also move a player up a keeper level at any point, but never down. 

Example - keeping someone with a 2nd that was drafted with a 3rd 

After 3 seasons of keeping a player they have the option to opt out and reenter the draft, however if they do not the 3 seasons restarts and they must wait again. 

AT THE END OF A 2K YOU MAY KEEP ONE PLAYER GOING INTO THE NEXT 2K

HOWEVER

you must move that player up a round. So first rounders are ineligible to be kept. Example - a player drafted round 3 being kept from 2k26 to 2k27 would need to be kept with a 2nd round pick. 

————————————————————

EXPANSION RULES

As this is a launch of a new league, depending on the success we may expand in the future. Upon expansion, to ensure that the league maintains all competitive balance and history intact, all round 1 and 2 players will be moved into the draft of the original 12 teams. Rounds 3-5 will be able to be kept, and round 2 players will be allowed to be moved up to a first to be kept. *This rule will only be in place if the expansion occurs within the first 3 seasons*

The expansion teams will be part of the draft lottery.



Regular Season Rules:

Lagout Rules (Regular Season)



All games must be played out in full regardless of connection issues.

No resets are allowed once the game has started.

The only exception: if a lagout occurs within the first 2 minutes of the game, a restart will be granted.

Each team is allowed one restart per game under this rule.

After the restart has been used, any future lagouts must be played out with no exceptions.

*THESE ARE ONLY REGULAR SEASON GUIDELINES FOR LAGOUTS*

————————————————————

*STICK SHOOTING IS ALLOWED IN THIS LEAGUE*

————————————————————

In regards to scheduling:

THERE WILL BE NO FORFEITS IN THIS LEAGUE. ALL REGULAR SEASON GAMES MUST BE PLAYED. 

AS A GM YOU SHOULD BE:

Cordial

Respectful

Understanding 

When it comes to scheduling games. 

There is a 15 min grace window after which disciplinary means may occur if a valid excuse is not provided. The GM who is late will then be at the behest of the other gm to reschedule or play. 

Please understand that everyone has real life priorities,  let’s be a community here.

———————————————————

The Regular Season will consist of 

TWO CONFERENCES 

UPA CONFERENCE AND HOF CONFERENCE

There will be a draft in the inaugural season by UPA rep and HOF rep to decide which teams will be in what conference. 

There will be 16  Regular Season games in the inaugural season which each team playing their conference 2 times (10 conf games) and the opposing conference 1 time each. 

You will have 3 weeks to complete the season with a deadline in each week.

Implement the plan as specified, it is attached for your reference. Do NOT edit the plan file itself.

To-do's from the plan have already been created. Do not create them again. Mark them as in_progress as you work, starting with the first one. Don't stop until you have completed all the to-dos.
